  abstract = {As tuition-free college policies spread rapidly across the states, an increasingly important policy debate has emerged regarding the optimal policy design of tuition-free college. However, existing scholarly evidence has focused almost exclusively on student outcomes, leaving the political decision-making processes among the public and policymakers unexamined. In this article, I leverage a nationally representative survey experiment and policy design theory to explore the power of social constructions of target populations in shaping a cornerstone of politically feasible tuition-free college---public opinion. In line with theoretical expectations, the analysis reveals that including a minimum high school GPA requirement increased support for tuition-free college, while targeting benefits to low-income families reduced perceptions of fairness, relative to a universal policy design. The findings also reveal that the effect of policy design on public perceptions of tuition-free college is moderated by region and age. Together, these findings reveal how a nationally representative sample of the public view the key policy design debates on tuition-free college and demonstrate the importance of social constructions of target populations for the study of higher education policy processes.},

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that schools often justify student performance differences using meritocratic ideals. One potential consequence of such ideals is the legitimization of outcome inequalities across various spheres, including those traditionally associated with equality and redistribution. In this study, we argue that the promotion of meritocratic values during school age can shape students' beliefs about meritocracy and influence their views on market-based access to health, pensions, and education. Using data from the 2017 National Study of Civic Education in Chile, which includes 5047 eighth-grade students from 231 schools, we estimated a series of multilevel models (lme4 library, R version 4.1.3) to test our hypotheses. Our findings show that a significant proportion of Chilean students agree with market justice principles---more so than adults. Most students endorse meritocratic views, particularly the notion that effort should be rewarded, which strongly correlates with market justice preferences: students who believe in meritocracy are more likely to justify inequalities based on financial capacity. At the school level, market justice preferences are higher in high-status schools but lower in schools with higher academic achievement. Furthermore, the conditional influence of meritocratic beliefs diminishes in schools with higher socioeconomic status and performance levels. These results suggest that the association between meritocratic beliefs and market justice preferences is already established at school age and is shaped by the school environment.},

  abstract = {Abstract Upon what kind of moral order does capitalism rest? Conversely, does the market give rise to a distinctive set of beliefs, habits, and social bonds? These questions are certainly as old as social science itself. In this review, we evaluate how today\&apos;s scholarship approaches the relationship between markets and the moral order. We begin with Hirschman\&apos;s characterization of the three rival views of the market as civilizing, destructive, or feeble in its effects on society. We review recent work at the intersection of sociology, economics, and political economy and show that these views persist both as theories of market society and moral arguments about it. We then argue that a fourth view, which we call moralized markets, has become increasingly prominent in economic sociology. This line of research sees markets as cultural phenomena and moral projects in their own right, and seeks to study the mechanisms and techniques by which such projects are realized in practice.},

  abstract = {Journal of Interdisciplinary History 31.3 (2001) 431-433 , , A meritocracy is an economy and society that rewards effort and ability, not family background. Sounds good. But individual ability is often inherited; educational attainment is influenced by family background; and effort and ability are often correlated. Complicating matters further, why is it "just" to reward ability? The twelve papers in Meritocracy and Economic Inequality address various aspects of the ambiguous term, coined in 1958 by Young.1, Americans equate a meritocracy with equality of opportunity and an open, forgiving, and publicly funded school system for all. To Americans, education has been the great equalizer, and generator, of a "just" [End Page 431] meritocracy. The European version, on the other hand, in which children of age ten or eleven were, and in places still are, tested for entrance to an elite cadre, substituted a cognitive elite for a titled and privileged gentry. This is a different vision of a meritocracy., Six years ago, Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein shocked the academic community with their claims that a new meritocratic order had taken hold in America (The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life [New York, 1994]). According to Murray and Herrnstein, education in the "new" economy, with its use of such technological devices as computers, can no longer overcome many differences in ability. Rather than a society in which individual effort matters and education is ameliorative, the new meritocratic order in America will tend to generate persistent class differences, reserving its greatest rewards for a group of intrinsically able individuals--the "cognitive elite." Although the essays in Meritocracy and Economic Inequality were not assembled to assess the Herrnstein and Murray thesis, the majority cite the book and assess its content., Roland B{\'e}nabou directly confronts the ambiguity in the term and constructs economic models of meritocratic orders. He distinguishes between a meritocracy that imposes equality of opportunity (rewarding ability and effort rather than family background) and one that enforces equality of outcomes and shows the impacts that each policy would have on growth and distribution. His essay complements that by John Roemer, whose work on distributive justice sets forth a framework of a meritocratic order that rewards effort rather than either ability or family background, as well as that by Amartya Sen, who assesses the meaning of rewarding merit and whether it is "just.", The remaining papers are empirical, and most can be organized into two groups. One assesses the degree to which effort, ability, and family background influence outcomes, such as earnings or social status. Another evaluates what happens when equality of outcomes is imposed. Thus, one group tries to understand the inner workings of a meritocracy; the other wrests with policy prescriptions to equalize results., Among my favorites is James Flynn's brief overview of his pioneering work showing that measured intelligence increased across the twentieth century in various countries (Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States, for example) and, thus, that iq scores are not immutable. Abstract reasoning and various analytical skills have been of increasing importance for the past 100 years, and these skills are the basis of modern iq tests. Flynn also argues, contrary to Herrnstein and Murray, that iq and class have not become more highly correlated over time., Several papers tackle why formal schooling is associated with increased income and whether correlations between schooling and income are due largely to "ability bias." Orley Ashenfelter and Cecilia Rouse review a large literature, and add to it, showing that standard econometric estimates of the returns to education are not generally biased by the possibility that the more able continue further with their education. [End Page 432] Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis try to understand how schooling can make people smarter and more productive., Robert Hauser et al. explore intergenerational mobility across much of the twentieth century, and Marcus Feldman et al. present evidence on...},

  abstract = {The defense of capitalism in America is rooted in a preference for the market's justice of earned deserts over the justices of equality and need associated with the polity. These preferences have structural roots in the way governments and markets serve different values and purposes, satisfy wants, focus on fairness or justice, enlist causal attributions, distribute or redistribute income, are limited by rights, and seem to offer either harmony or conflict of interest. Some of these ``structural'' differences, however, are themselves perceptual, and corrected by changed perceptions of the productivity of government and of our historic predecessors, and by a community point of view involving changed accounting systems, as well as by policies of full employment rather than guaranteed incomes. With few institutional changes, these altered perceptions may partially restore political justice to favor.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an empirical analysis of the socioeconomic status (SES) school segregation in Chile, whose educational system is regarded as an extreme case of a market-oriented education. The study estimated the magnitude and evolution of the SES segregation of schools at both national and local levels, and it studied the relationship between some local educational market dynamics and the observed magnitude of SES school segregation at municipal level. The main findings were: first, the magnitude of the SES segregation of both low-SES and high-SES students in Chile was very high (Duncan Index ranged from 0.50 to 0.60 in 2008); second, during the last decade, SES school segregation tended to slightly increase in Chile, especially in high schools (both public and private schools); third, private schools -- including voucher schools -- were more segregated than public schools for both low-SES and high-SES students; and finally, some market dynamics operating in the Chilean education (like privatization, school choice, and fee-paying) accounted for a relevant proportion of the observed variation in SES school segregation at municipal level. These findings are analyzed from an educational policy perspective in which the link between SES school segregation and market-oriented mechanisms in education plays a fundamental role.},
